        <h2> Personal Statement</h2>
        <p>
            The world as we know was forever changed when we first invented the computer.
            Industries have been created and destroyed in an instant compared to the magnitude of time that comprises history.
            To ignore this incredible might that most only scrape the surface of would be the actions of a fool.
            As such, I aim to <em>command</em> this force to propel me deeper into this new age, both to provide these tools to the masses and to hoard power selfishly.
            My efforts <em>will</em> succeed, and I ask of you to consider me a viable employee so that we may further each other into the annals of time.

            <h3><strong>Co-op</strong></h3>
            <p>
                I have previously worked a summer job at a co-op that was local to my area as a customer assistant.
                This Work mainly involved working at the tills to serve customers and facing the shelves that were nearby to the tills.
                Additional work often involved restocking shelves during the earlier hours and answering any questions that were asked by customers.

            <h3><strong>Loca Vortex</strong></h3>
            <p> 
                I have also worked for a startup company by the name of Loca Vortex that provided software as a service to companies.
                For this job my main work was to set up the software for companies and explain how to use them for both the clients and other members of our team.
                As this was a kickstart job I worked the full 6 months, but couldn't be kept on afterwards due to the company's financial difficulties.
